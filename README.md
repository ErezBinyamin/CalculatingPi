# CalculatingPi
When Run a GUI will appear: <br />
<br />
In the top left corner there will be a space to enter an "x" value to evaluate ArcTan(x) on. <br />
In the top right corner there will be a space to enter an "n" value to increase accuracy of all π approximations. <br />
In the bottom left, there is a button labled "solve". This must be pressed in order to evaluate the approximations. <br />
<br />
The top four results are π approximations using increasingly accurate combinations of ArcTan values. <br />
The higher the inputted "n" value, the more terms will be included in the taylor polynomial ArcTan approximation, and the more accurate <br />
the estimation of π will be. <br />
<br />
The fifth result is simply the ArcTan(x) approximation. This uses the "x value" and "n value". Again the higher the "n value", <br />
the more accurate the approximation will be.<br />
<br />
The final result is the great Ramanujan–Sato function. This is the fastest converging function to π known to man.
